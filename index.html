                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    C is a general purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, 
                    lexical variable scope and recursion. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical
                     machine instructions and has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language.
                      Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computers, from supercomputers 
                      to embedded systems

                <h2>Originated</h2>
                <p>
                    C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to make
                     utilities running on Unix. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become 
                     one of the most widely used programming languages with C compilers from various vendors 
                     available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems.
                      C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989 and by the International Organization for Standardization.

                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>
                    It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straight forward compiler to provide low level access to memory
                     and language with minimal run time support. 
                    Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming.
                     The language is available on various platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers.
